        <h4>How would you describe yourself?</h4>
        <p>Anyone who knows me knows I’m full of energy, always up for a new challenge and
           getting stuck in. I love the opportunities at York and really feel I’m the type 
           of person who makes the most of them. I’m a bit of a nerd, as I love everything 
           sci-fi and science, but I’m up for a laugh and love getting out of my comfort zone.
          <br>
           I’m always thinking about how to make other people around me happier - it is after 
           all the reason why I organised the Campus East Christmas Events, volunteer in York 
           College with York Students in Schools, and sit on multiple society committees. Oh, 
           and did I mention I dress up as Where’s Wally to make people smile during exam season?

        <h4>Why are you running for the position?</h4>
        <p>
          I’m running because, like all the candidates, I think I can make a difference for 
          student activities on campus. However, I’ll be bringing both a fresh perspective 
          and a fresh character to the role. I want to bring my original ideas (such as a 
          refreshers fair and skills-based courses) to the table whilst continuing with 
          initiatives already put forward by the previous Activities Officer.
          <br>
          My drive and over the top, 110% attitude mean I’ll be able to work on projects which 
          matter to students and campaign on initiatives which benefit everyone. I love what 
          York has given to me and want to give back to York in the best way possible.

      <section>
        <h4>Why are you the best person for the role?</h4>
        <p>
          I might appear silly dressed as Wally, but my depth of experience and my energy are 
          what set me apart from the other candidates. I’m a member of seven different 
          societies currently and have been involved with many others in the past. From shooting 
          zombies with Nerf guns and promoting green energy, to relaxing in the student cinema 
          and learning about finance, I’ve taken part in a variety of student activities and as 
          such know what different students want from their time at uni. I recognise there isn’t 
          one type of student and that there isn’t one type of activity that satisfies all of 
          them – hence my range of ideas for increasing the number of activities on campus and 
          making them more accessible than ever before.
          <br>
          I love helping others and never stop until the job is done. I know if I’m elected as 
          Student Activities Officer I’ll work tirelessly to make York better for everyone. 
          I’ve already demonstrated my commitment to this by the improvements I’ve helped push 
          through on my course and the social activities I organised over Christmas. I want to 
          keep making people smile and know this role is the opportunity to do just that.

        <h4>What is best about York?</h4>
        <p>
          Hands down, the best thing about York is the variety of things to do: our societies, 
          our studies, and our students, all make living in York a fantastic experience. Not 
          one student’s time here is the same because of the wide range of activities on offer. 
          I’ve been really lucky in my time here and want to give every student the opportunity 
          to have the range of experiences I’ve had.
