        <h4> 1. Refreshers Fair </h4>
        <p> Implement a refreshers fair to allow students to engage with student groups.
            <br>
            Fairs allow for enthusiastic members of student groups to introduce to their peers new and
            exciting hobbies they never knew they loved before. Student groups themselves provide an
            important break from study and offer an opportunity for people to become more well-rounded. The
            fairs also give a unique opportunity for student groups to advertise what they love and gain new
            members in the process.
            <br>
            It’s all too easy to be caught ill, tired or busy for the first freshers fair, meaning students miss a
            valuable opportunity to engage with student groups. Of course, we can join later in the year, but it
            can be intimidating entering a new group for many reasons. It’s hard trying a new activity when you
            haven’t even had a brief talk about it with a friendly face. Give it a Go does a valuable job of
            encouraging students to try new things, but a refreshers fair would only increase students’
            engagement levels with student groups. It would provide an opportunity for students to spot the
            society for them that they might have otherwise missed until the next fair taking place in September. </p>

        <h4> 2. Skill-Based Courses </h4>
        <p> Introduce new skill-based courses for students.
            <br>
            A university degree is a professional qualification which I recognise many people are here for.
            Despite the enjoyment that many people derive from societies, some people may not want to be
            involved in them. I think there’s a real opportunity to expand the YUSU Develops programme as well
            as other skill-based courses already provided by the university. Many introductory courses in
            programming, research and business are offered by the library along with Careers and Placements
            but the ability to access intermediate and advanced courses are very limited along with certain key
            skill courses.
            <br>
            By working with various university groups including student groups, the library and departments,
            I would look to introduce and promote more advanced courses solidifying people’s skills in talents
            outside their degree. Ideas include offering intermediate programming classes, more business-
            related programmes and increasing awareness of courses like British Sign Language. This will directly
            benefit students by raising not only their employability but also their general skill sets, provide an
            alternative way to get involved whilst at university and make new friends for a lifetime. </p>

        <h4> 3. Activities Access Grants </h4>
        <p> Support and expand the Activities Access Grants for students who need it most.
            <br>
            Currently society membership fees are waived up to a value of £20 for first year students
            coming from a household with an income less than £35,000 per year. However, a maximum of only
            75 students can claim the grant. I want to develop this by increasing funding to allow for even more
            students to be able to apply for it.
            <br>
            Additionally, I would look to support existing plans for this to be expanded to students on the
            Disabled Students' Allowance. I believe anyone on the DSA deserves the opportunity to throw
            themselves fully into societies at York without hinderance. </p>

        <h4> 4. Free Societies </h4>
        <p> Foster an environment for free societies to be created and maintained.
            <br>
            Student finances are rightfully an important topic to a lot of people at this university, but
            this shouldn’t affect students’ ability to join in with activities. Pressure on societies to charge
            membership fees should be relaxed where possible as zero-cost activities and societies with
            alternative sources of funding needn’t be pushed into putting a pay wall behind their activities. Free
            societies give a valuable opportunity for students with tight budgets to still socialise and engage with
            the community.
            <br>
            Publicity for free societies can and should be increased. YUSU and colleges can help advertise
            these, allowing for more students to become aware of opportunities available to them around
            university as well as YUSU looking to provide some basic funding for these societies. </p>

        <h4> 5. Raising and Giving Events </h4>
        <p> Push RAG to organise more local events.
            <br>
            Raising and Giving offer fantastic opportunities for students to develop skills and raise money for
            charities they believe in. It’s clear that RAG is an important part of YUSU’s operations and makes a
            positive impact on not only the charities it raises money for but the students that engage with it.
            <br>
            However, there should be an increased focused on local projects, like SASH, York Mind and SNAPPY
            to name a few. Overseas volunteering and charity events provide a once in a life time opportunity
            for students and they should be maintained for the future, but more local projects should also be
            encouraged. I would work with the RAG officer to push for more ways to raise money on campus for
            charities. This opens up opportunities for people still looking to help and increases the total amount
            of volunteering opportunities available. </p>

        <h4> 6. Free Speech </h4>
        <p> Continue to support free speech on campus.
            <br>
            Free speech remains a major point of concern for a lot of students coming into and being at
            university. It’s important to be exposed to a variety of opinions whilst at university and indeed
            makes the experience richer for many. I’m delighted at the stance the current Activities Officer took
            towards free speech and want to make clear that I will continue to preserve free speech on campus. </p>
